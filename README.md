[Write your reflection here]

The most challenging part of this lab was completing the push requests to the Git repository through VScode. I innitially had some larger images I was going to upload but it kept giving me errors when I would try and
commit the merge. I had to remove them and recopy the repository in order for the error to go away. I learned how important the divider tags (nav, main, header, footer) are to ensure accessability and readability by the DOM even though they seem like minor things that no one can see. In the future I plan to add a lot of my projects I have made and some of my artwork to the hobbies page. This will require me to somehow reduce the file sizes of the images or uplaod them directly to GitHub through the browser to avoid the error I already had.

*This portfolio will grow throughout the semester as you add React components and full-stack projects!*
