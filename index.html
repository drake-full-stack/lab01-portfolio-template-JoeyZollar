        <p>
            Hi, I am Joey! I am a driven graphic designer and computer scientist from Prior Lake, Minnesota, currently pursuing my undergraduate at Drake University. My goal is to apply relevant digital and design skills to create captivating graphical and web designs. Whether through coding, Adobe software, or good old-fashioned pencil and paper, I love to tie in my creative process anywhere I can. The job is never done until I am satisfied that my work is as effective and striking as possible. I always love to mix things up in my designs and think about the solutions others may not be considering.
